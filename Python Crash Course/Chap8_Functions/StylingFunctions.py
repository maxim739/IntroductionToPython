#When making functions, remember that they should have very descriptive names
#The names should be lowercase and underscore
#Every function should have an area which describes precisley what it does
#If you specify a specific value for a parameter, no spaces should be used on either side of the equals sign
	#def function_name(parameter0, parameter1='default value'):
#The same thing is said for keyword arguments in the function calls
	#function_name(value0, parameter1='value')
