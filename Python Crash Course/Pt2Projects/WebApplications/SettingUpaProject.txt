When beginning we need to describe the project in a specification or spec, and set up a virtual environment to build the project

Writing a spec:
	A full spec describes he project goals and project fucntionality
Here we will write a n app called Learning Log that allows uses to log the topics they're intreseted in 
and to make journal entries as they learn about each topic. The learning log home page will descibe the 
site and invite users to log in or sign up. Once logged in a user can create new topics, add new entries, 
and read and edit existing entries

Creating a virtual environment:
A virtual environment is a place on your system where you can install packages and isolate them from all ther python packages

create a new directory for your project called laearning_log, switch to that directory in terminal, and enter the following code to create a virtual environment

python -m venv ll_env
