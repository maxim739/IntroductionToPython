Here we learn about how to write easy, efficient programs which now can be made more relevant and useful.
	In this chapter we will work with files that can quickly analyze lots of data
Learn to handle unexpected situations and errors, as well as the json module which stores data when the code has stopped running
This makes your programs easier to use as people can work with files and enter data, and then exit the program and pick up where they left off.
Also learn how to deal with files that dont exist and why programs crash
This makes the program robust when it encounters bad data and malicious attempts occur.
